# Azure Policy to deploy Azure Lighthouse at Management Group-level

Pre-requisite: Register subscriptions for the RP ManagedServices. Otherwise, the policy will not run.

Deploy this Policy at the management group level to delegate subscriptions within the management group to a managing tenant via Azure Lighthouse. 

`
New-AzManagementGroupDeployment -Name <nameofDeployment> -Location <location> -ManagementGroupId <nameOfMg> -TemplateFile <path to file> -TemplateParameterFile <path to parameter file> -verbose
`

This command will add the policy definition under the deployed mangement group. You need to create the assigment and remediation task for existing subscriptions.

This Policy has a DeployIfNotExists effect, evaluating subscriptions within a management group to determine if there are Lighthouse delegations. If not, then a deployment to the specified managing tenant is executed.
